  <h2>What is this recipe about</h2>
  <h3>Peach cobbler is a fruit dessert with a biscuit-like topping, often made with fresh, frozen, or canned peaches mixed with sugar, spices, lemon juice, and cornstarch. Frozen or canned work well (4 cups fresh = 2 cans or 40 oz frozen). Choose ripe peaches that are fragrant and slightly soft; unripe ones can ripen at room temp. Peeling is optional, though blanching makes it easier. It's best served warm (with ice cream) but keeps up to four days in the fridge and reheats in the oven or microwave.</h3>
