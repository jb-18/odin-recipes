  <h2>Ooey-est of the Gooey-est</h2>
  <h3>Ooey Gooey Cake is a rich, buttery dessert with a soft, chewy crust and a creamy, custard-like topping. Made with a cake base (often yellow cake mix, butter, and eggs) and a sweet cream cheese mixture layered on top, it bakes into a golden, slightly crisp edge with a soft, “gooey” center. Sweet, indulgent, and melt-in-your-mouth, it;s often dusted with powdered sugar and served as a crowd-pleasing treat for any occasion.</h3>
