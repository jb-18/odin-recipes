    <h1>Meatball Sub</h1>

    <h2>What is that ball of meat about</h2>
    <h3>The recipe for meatball subs involves four main steps: make baked meatballs from ground beef, bread crumbs, eggs, Parmesan, garlic, and spices; prepare the baguette by hollowing, seasoning, and toasting; heat spaghetti sauce and coat the meatballs; then assemble the sandwich with meatballs, sauce, and provolone before baking until melted. Store-bought spaghetti sauce works well, though homemade is an option. Serve with light sides like salad. Whole subs don't store well, but the meatballs and sauce can be refrigerated up to five days and reheated for easy assembly later.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>¾ cup bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 French baguette</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>4 slices provolone cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, garlic, Parmesan cheese, parsley, and Italian seasoning in a large bowl. Mix with your hands until well combined. Shape mixture into 12 meatballs, and place in a baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake meatballs in the preheated oven until cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).</li>
        <li>While the meatballs are cooking, cut baguette in half lengthwise and open like a book. Remove and discard some of the bread from the inside to make a well for the meatballs.</li>
        <li>Brush baguette with olive oil and season with garlic powder and salt. Place baguette on a baking tray, open and with the oiled sides facing up.</li>
        <li>When the meatballs have 5 minutes left, slip the baguette into the oven and cook until lightly toasted.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, warm spaghetti sauce in a saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Remove meatballs from the oven. Use a slotted spoon to transfer them to the hot sauce; mix gently to coat with sauce.</li>
        <li>Spoon meatballs and sauce into one side of the baguette, nestling meatballs in the well. Top with slices of provolone cheese.</li>
        <li>Return to the oven until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool slightly, then cut into 4 sandwiches.</li>
    </ol>
